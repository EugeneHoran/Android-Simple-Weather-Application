# Simple-Weather


[OpenWeatherMap API Documentation](http://openweathermap.org/api) 
 
- This application is only for location based response through GPS.  Next update will be a full application that switches between Network and GPS for the best response. If you do not have GPS on or the connection to GPS is weak, it will not generate the response. 
- Fetching data from OpenWeatherMap formatted as JSON.
- In the query string, we pass the Latitude, Longitude and the imperial system the results should be in.
- Using the HttpURLConnection class to make the remote request.
- Making two requests, one for the current location weather and the other for the five day forecast. 
- APK is within the file for download.
